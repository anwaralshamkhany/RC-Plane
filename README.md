# RC-Plane
# 3D-Printed RC Plane

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and build a fully functional, 3D-printed RC plane. It includes detailed CAD models created in SolidWorks, flight control algorithms written in C++, and aerodynamic simulations performed in MATLAB.

## Repository Structure
- `CAD/`: Contains all CAD files.
  - `SolidWorks/`: SolidWorks part and assembly files.
  - `STL/`: STL files for 3D printing.
- `Code/`: All source code.
  - `Arduino/`: C++ code for Arduino-based flight control.
  - `MATLAB/`: MATLAB scripts for simulations.
  - `Simulations/`: Other simulation files.
- `Documentation/`: Design documents, test results, and images.
  - `DesignDocs/`: Design documents and plans.
  - `FlightTests/`: Results and analysis from flight tests.
  - `Images/`: Design and test images.
- `Resources/`: Reference materials and datasheets.
  - `BOM/`: Bill of Materials with all the needed components to purchase.
  - `Datasheets/`: Datasheets for electronic components.
  - `References/`: Reference materials and links.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anwaralshamkhany/RC-Plane.git
    ```
2. Open the `SolidWorks` folder to view CAD models.
3. Navigate to the `Code/Arduino` folder for flight control code.

## Usage
- **SolidWorks Models**: Open `.SLDPRT` and `.SLDASM` files with SolidWorks.
- **Arduino Code**: Use the Arduino IDE to upload the flight control code to your RC plane.
- **MATLAB Scripts**: Run MATLAB scripts in the `MATLAB` folder for aerodynamic simulations.
